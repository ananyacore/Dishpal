                Here are three vegetarian Indian-inspired breakfast recipes using only the permitted ingredients, aiming for under 500 calories each.  Note that calorie counts are estimates and can vary based on specific brands and portion sizes.


**1.  Spicy Black Bean & Quinoa Upma**

**Ingredients:**

* 1/2 cup quinoa, rinsed
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 cup canned black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1/4 cup canned diced tomatoes, drained
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 tsp cumin powder
* 1/4 tsp turmeric powder
* 1/4 tsp garam masala powder
* Salt to taste
* 1 tbsp chopped cilantro (optional)
            </div>
            
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <div class="instructions">
                **Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Quinoa:** Rinse the quinoa thoroughly under cold water. In a small saucepan, combine the quinoa and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed and the quinoa is cooked through. Fluff with a fork and set aside.
2. **Sauté the Aromatics:** Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the cumin powder and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.  Be careful not to burn the spices.
3. **Add Vegetables and Spices:** Add the canned diced tomatoes and sauté for 2-3 minutes until slightly softened. Stir in the turmeric powder and garam masala powder. Cook for another minute, allowing the spices to bloom and blend with the tomatoes.
4. **Combine and Simmer:** Add the cooked quinoa and black beans to the pan. Mix well to combine all the ingredients. Season with salt to taste. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
5. **Garnish and Serve:** Remove from heat and garnish with chopped cilantro, if desired. Serve warm as a hearty and flavorful breakfast upma.

**2.  Savory Oatmeal with Almond Butter & Tomatoes**

**Ingredients:**

* 1/2 cup rolled oats
* 1 cup water
* 1/4 cup canned diced tomatoes, drained
* 1 tbsp almond butter
* 1/4 tsp turmeric powder
* A pinch of salt
* 1 tbsp chopped cilantro (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Cook the Oatmeal:** In a small saucepan, combine the rolled oats and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the oats are cooked through and have absorbed most of the water. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
2. **Stir in Flavors:**  Once the oats are cooked, stir in the turmeric powder and salt.  Mix well to incorporate the spices throughout the oatmeal.
3. **Add Tomatoes and Almond Butter:** Gently stir in the drained canned diced tomatoes and almond butter. Continue to cook for another minute or two, allowing the flavors to blend. The almond butter will slightly thicken the oatmeal.
4. **Serve:**  Remove from heat and garnish with chopped cilantro, if desired.  Serve warm.  This savory oatmeal provides a healthy and satisfying breakfast option.

**3.  Lentil and Rice Breakfast Bowl with Coconut Flakes**

**Ingredients:**

* 1/2 cup red lentils (masoor dal), rinsed
* 1/2 cup basmati rice, rinsed
* 1 cup water
* 1/4 tsp turmeric powder
* 1/4 tsp cumin powder
* Salt to taste
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp coconut flakes

**Instructions:**

1. **Cook the Lentils and Rice:** In a small saucepan, combine the rinsed red lentils, basmati rice, water, turmeric powder, cumin powder, and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the lentils and rice are cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.  Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and to ensure even cooking.
2. **Sauté Coconut Flakes (Optional):** While the lentils and rice are cooking, you can lightly sauté the coconut flakes in a separate pan with a little olive oil until lightly browned and fragrant for an added touch of flavor and texture. Be careful not to burn them.
3. **Combine and Serve:** Once the lentils and rice are cooked, gently fluff with a fork.  If you sautéed the coconut flakes, stir them into the cooked lentil and rice mixture. Serve warm. This provides a wholesome and nutritious breakfast bowl.
